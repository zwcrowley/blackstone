\title{Creates a data frame that is a summary table of counts and percentages}
\usage{
dataSumm(var, na.rm = TRUE, sort_n = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{A column selected from a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble}/data frame that is a categorical/factor variable to that to be summarized into a table.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical, defaults to TRUE. Drops NA values.}

\item{sort_n}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, sorts the data by the count of each response (n_answers).
If FALSE, sorts by response.}
}
\value{
a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} with the data in 5 columns: item, response, n_answers, percent_answers and percent_answers_label.
Item is the name of the original item, Response is all of the categorical responses possible for the item. n_answers is the count of each response,
percent_answers is the percentage of each response and percent_answers_label is a character variable of percentage labelled with percent sign for use as a label.
