\title{Recode Numeric Variables to Factor Variables}
\usage{
recodeCat(df, scale_labels)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Required, a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble}/data frame of survey items that are numeric variables that need to be converted
into factor variables, Can be anywhere from 3 to 7 point scales.}

\item{scale_labels}{Required, a named character vector of labels of the desired scale levels for the new factor variables.
The function will use this vector to convert the numeric variables into factor variables, all levels must be supplied in the correct range
otherwise else NA will be returned for variables outside the range of user supplied values. The named character vector should have the new
labels as the "name" and the old labels as the "variable" like this: c("\if{html}{\out{<new label>}}" = "\if{html}{\out{<original variable value>}}") which would look like this:
\code{levels_min_ext <- c("Minimal" = "1", "Slight" = "2", "Moderate" = "3", "Good" = "4", "Extensive" = "5")}}
}
\value{
a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} with the original numeric variables along with
new variables that are now factors with the prefix \verb{cat_\{variable_name\}}, with levels taken from scale_labels character
vector.
