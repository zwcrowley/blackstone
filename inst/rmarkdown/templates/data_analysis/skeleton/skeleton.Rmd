## RMarkdown Template for Data Analysis at Blackstone Research and Evaluation:

This file is the starting point for any data analysis task at Blackstone Research and Evaluation. The examples provided are for a baseline-annual (pre-post) survey comparison, but there are many ways this workflow can be used for other data tasks. Please provide any feedback from the use of this template to determine if there are more tasks to include or other templates to construct. 

First, change the title and author in the yaml header above on lines 2 and 3, (leave in quotes), these will then render to the html document. Clicking the "knit" button in the RStudio interface will render this document as an .html file. 

## Loading baseline and annual data from .csv and .xlsx:
### How to read in .xlsx data:
```{r load in .xlsx data example}
# readxl is a package that has the most up to date function for reading in excel files either .xls or xlsx, read_excel(), if you know the file is .xlsx you can use 
# the function read_xlsx(), both are shown below:
# For this example, the baseline data is in a folder called "extdata" which is located up four folders so ../ moves up one folder-
# Read in the baseline.xlsx data using read_excel():
baseline <- read_excel("../../../../extdata/baseline.xlsx")

# Read in the annual.xlsx data using read_xlsx():
annual <- read_xlsx("../../../../extdata/annual.xlsx")
# Remove to resuse names:
rm(annual, baseline)
```

### How to read in .csv data:
```{r load in .csv data example}
# readr is a package included in "tidyverse" that has the most up to date function for reading in .csv data, read_csv():
# For this example, the baseline data is in a folder called "extdata" which is located up four folders so ../ moves up one folder-
# Read in the baseline.csv data:
baseline <- read_csv("../../../../extdata/baseline.csv")

# Read in the annual.csv data:
annual <- read_csv("../../../../extdata/annual.csv")
```


#### Info about example data in baseline and annual datasets:

Each dataset contains 7 variables and 20 observations. 

- Unique Identifier: a unique ID (1 to 20)
- role: 1= "Undergraduate student", 2 ="Graduate student", 3= "Postdoc", 4 = "Faculty"
- Gender: 1 = "male", 2 = "female", 3 = "other"
- Institution: 1 = "University of Place", 2 = "State University of Another Place", 3 = "Technical State", 4 = "University of One More Place"
- 5 variables of that make up a composite scale: Organization, Source, Publish, Write, Research
 - these are all on a 5-point Likert scale of 1 to 5 needs to be recoded to: c("Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate", "Good", "Extensive")

## Merging data:

The R package `dplyr`, which is included in `tidyverse`, includes many functions to merge data sets, the most common of the "outer join" functions are `left_join()` and `full_join()`.

Use `full_join()` if you want to merge two datasets and include all the observations of both datasets, this is most commonly used if you want to join the datasets top to bottom, see the [dpylr's documentation for more examples](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html).

For most uses at Blackstone Research and Evaluation, data will be merged using `left_join()`, this function is used to merge data that share a common unique identifier and only keep observations that occur in one of the datasets. Specically, `left_join()` keeps all of the observations in the first supplied dataset and merges all of the observations in the second dataset that matches the user supplied "by" variable in the first dataset.

```{r Merge data}
# Merge the baseline and annual datasets using the variable `Unique Identifier` as the by argument inside join_by(""), this is the variable that will match the observations from both datasets, the suffix argument is a c() of length two which is added to variables taken from the respective datasets, so for this example variables from baseline will have a suffix of "{variable_name}_pre" and variables from annual will have  "{variable_name}_post":
merged_data <- baseline %>% left_join(., annual, by = join_by("Unique Identifier"), suffix = c("_pre","_post"))
# can also be written: merged_data <- left_join(baseline, annual, by = join_by("Unique Identifier", "role"), suffix = c("_pre","_post"))
# the new merged data has 14 variables, the original 9 from baseline and the 5 that match from the annuals dataset.
# head(merged_data, n = 4)


# If you would rather use a prefix for pre and post this is one way to do that:
# add prefix before joining, for baseline skip the first 4 vars and annual skip first var:
names(baseline)[5:9] <- paste0("pre_", names(baseline)[5:9])
names(annual)[2:6] <- paste0("post_", names(annual)[2:6])
# in join, use names with prefixes
merged_data <- baseline %>% left_join(annual, by = join_by("Unique Identifier")) 
# check variables from the merged_data using str() and summary():
str(merged_data)
# merged_data contains all numeric variables with has 14 variables and 20 observations. 
```
## Clean up variable names:
```{r clean var names}
# The janitor package has a lot of functions to help clean data below will do the following:
# Clean up column names and take out empty/constant columns (not necessary here but showing its available):
merged_data <- merged_data %>% clean_names() %>% remove_empty() %>% remove_constant() 

# Get a list of all columns names:
colnames(merged_data)

# All the column names are pretty easy to use but one change may be better- 
# Rename column names, this renames unique_identifier as unique_id:
merged_data <- merged_data %>% rename(., unique_id = unique_identifier)
```


## How to recode numeric variables to factor/categorical variables:

First, in order to use the variable "role" from the merged_data we need to change it to a factor/categorical variables:
```{r recode role}
# For all of the data analysis in this template, the tidyverse will be the basis of all the data manipulation, the use of the mutate() and case_when() from "dplyr" is a simple way to create a new variable in R, I will add a prefix of "cat_{variable_name}" to signifiy the new variable is a category not numeric:
# role = role of respondent takes on a scale of 1 to 4 needs to be recoded to:1= "Undergraduate student", 2 ="Graduate student", 3= "Postdoc", 4 = "Faculty"
merged_data <- merged_data %>% mutate(cat_role = factor(case_when(
                                           role == 1 ~ "Undergraduate student",
                                           role == 2 ~ "Graduate student",
                                           role == 3 ~ "Postdoc",
                                           role == 4 ~ "Faculty"
                                          ), levels = c("Undergraduate student", "Graduate student", "Postdoc", "Faculty"))
                      )
# case_when() takes in a statement on the left side of the ~ and when that is true returns the statement on the right side of the ~ to the new variable, in this case cat_role
# so when role == 1 then cat_role will be == "Undergraduate student" and so on.
# bre package also has a function that works similar to the above code called recodeCat(), This function takes in a df, use the scale_labels argument to pass the new labels in the order of the number_levels which you can also pass as an argument, returns a the original variable(s) new factor variable named "cat_{variable(s)}":
cat_role <- merged_data %>% select(role) %>% 
    recodeCat(scale_labels = c("Undergraduate student", "Graduate student", "Postdoc", "Faculty"), number_levels = c(1,2,3,4)) %>% select(cat_role) 
# Add new cat_role variable back to merged data:
merged_data <- merged_data %>% mutate(cat_role)
```

Next, in order to use the variable "gender" from the merged_data we need to change it to a factor/categorical variables:

```{r recode gender}
# recode gender with recodeCat():
cat_gender <- merged_data %>% select(gender) %>% 
    recodeCat(scale_labels = c("male", "female", "other")) %>% select(cat_gender) 
# Add new cat_gender variable back to merged data:
merged_data <- merged_data %>% mutate(cat_gender)
```

Recode institution from the merged_data and change it to a factor/categorical variable:

```{r recode institution}
# recode institution with recodeCat():
cat_institution <- merged_data %>% select(institution) %>% 
    recodeCat(scale_labels = c("University of Place", "State University of Another Place", "Technical State", "University of One More Place")) %>% 
    select(cat_institution) 
# Add new cat_institution variable back to merged data:
merged_data <- merged_data %>% mutate(cat_institution)
```

## Frequency Tables for all demographics:

A common task at Blackstone Research and Evaluation for data analysis is creating frequency tables, the next examples will show how to do with with *bre* package.

```{r freq table for role}
# The first step is to us the dataSumm() from "bre" to calculate frequency and percentages of the variable, be sure to use the recoded factor var with "cat_" prefix:
role_summ <- merged_data %>% select(cat_role) %>% bre::dataSumm()
role_summ
# Next, the tblSumm() from "bre" will use flextable() to create a nice formatted table that can be rendered to html and also works nicely in .pptx and .docx
tbl_role <- role_summ %>% tblSumm()
tbl_role
```

Now, do the same thing for gender and institution:

```{r freq tables for gender and institution}
# dataSumm() and tblSumm() from "bre" can be used in one line to calculate frequency and percentages of the variable and make flextable output:
# gender
tbl_gender <- merged_data %>% select(cat_gender) %>% dataSumm() %>% tblSumm()
tbl_gender
# institution
tbl_institution <- merged_data %>% select(cat_institution) %>% dataSumm() %>% tblSumm()
tbl_institution
```

## How to recode Likert scale items: 

In the current Blackstone Research and Evaluation workflow, the most common data analysis is with survey items with Likert scales, usually 1-5 point scales. In the example data provided, the 5 variables named: Organization, Source, Publish, Write, Research. These variables represent items with 5-point Likert scales. The following code will create new factor variables from the numeric variables on 1-5 point scales with the correct labels of: "Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate", "Good", "Extensive".

```{r recode likert items}
# recodeCat() from bre package takes in a tibble/data frame of as many variables that share the same desired scale_labels, use the scale_labels argument to pass the new labels in the order of the number_levels which you can also pass as an argument.
# Returns the original variable(s) and the new factor variable(s) named "cat_{variable(s)}":
# use the : symbol to select all the variables that are consecutive in the tibble, i.e. select(pre_organization:post_write) selects all the likert scale items,
# the second select call (select()) selects all the new variables created with the prefix "cat_{variable(s)}":
cat_likert_items <- merged_data %>% select(pre_organization:post_research) %>% 
    recodeCat(scale_labels = c("Minimal", "Slight", "Moderate", "Good", "Extensive"), number_levels = c(1,2,3,4,5)) %>% select(contains("cat")) 
# Add the new cat_items df to merged data:
merged_data <- merged_data %>% mutate(cat_likert_items)
# Check the data:
str(merged_data)
```

The new items are added to the merged_data tibble and are now factor variables ready for use.


## Table with Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) for Numeric Items:

The following code with create a three new variables: mean for the "pre_" "post_" Likert items, mean for the "post_" Likert items, and a difference score of "post_" mean minus "pre_" mean. Then, it will create a table with the mean and SD using the function tbl_summary from the *gtsummary* package:

```{r table with mean and SD}
# use the original numeric variables: pre Likert items = pre_organization:pre_research, post Likert items = post_organization:post_research
# First, if we needed to change a value to NA this is one way to do it quickly, not needed for this data so will comment out:
# merged_data <- merged_data %>% mutate(across(pre_organization:pre_research, ~ifelse(. == 9, NA, .)),
#                                      (across(post_organization:post_research, ~ifelse(. == 9, NA, .))))

# Create Composites means for the 5 pre Likert items (pre_items) and 5 post Likert items (post_items):
# Also, create a new variable for difference btw pre and post= diff_items (this will be used in a test for normality, shapiro test), rowwise() is a function from dplyr package that allows you to compute new row by row, this will return means for pre and post for each individual row, not overall:
merged_data <- merged_data %>% rowwise() %>% mutate(pre_items = mean(c_across(pre_organization:pre_research), na.rm = TRUE),
                                                    post_items = mean(c_across(post_organization:post_research), na.rm = TRUE),
                                                    diff_items = post_items - pre_items)


# Table for M and SD for pre-post composites:
merged_data %>%
  select(pre_items, post_items) %>%
  tbl_summary(statistic = list(all_continuous()~ "{mean}, ({sd})"),
              type = list(pre_items ~ 'continuous', post_items ~ 'continuous'),
              label =  list(pre_items~ 'Pre Likert Items',
                            post_items ~ 'Post Likert Items'),
              missing_text = "Missing")%>%
  add_stat_label() %>%
  bold_labels() %>%
  modify_header(label ~ "**Variable**") %>%
  modify_caption("Mean and SD of Likert Items")

```

## How to Test for Normality using pre-post difference scores:

If we want to check to see if a pre-post means/composite scores are normally distributed (in order to use parametric tests like t-tests), we should use the Shapiro-Wilk Test. This requires a difference score of the pre-post means. Shapiro-Wilk tests have a null hypothesis that the data is distributed *normally*, so if the test is significant that means that the data is *not* distributed normally and parametric tests should *not* be used. (Use non-parametric tests like Wilcoxon test). If the Shapiro-Wilk is not significant the data is distributed normally and parametric tests (like t-tests) can be used.
```{r Check normality assumption for difference scores-Shapiro Test}
# test for normality on the differences score of the Likert items:
shapiro.test(merged_data$diff_items)
```
Test was *not* significant so the data is normally distributed, will can use a t-test for pre-post analysis.

## How to use a t-test with pre-post mean/composite scores:

If data is pre-post then a paired t-test should be used, below shows the code for that:

```{r t-test for pre-post items, warning=FALSE}
# t-tests for parametric analysis
t_test_items <- t.test(merged_data$pre_items, merged_data$post_items, paired = TRUE)
t_test_items
```


The t-test has a null hypothesis that the data is not meaningfully different, so if the test is significant we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the pre-post means are meaningfully different. The t-test above was significant as shown by the very small p-value = `r t_test_items$p.value`.


## How to use a Wilcoxon test with pre-post mean/composite scores:

If the data was not normally distributed, then use a Wilcoxon test, it the data  is pre-post then a paired Wilcoxon test should be used, below shows the code for that:

```{r Wilcoxon test for pre-post items, warning=FALSE}
# Wilcoxon test for non-parametric analysis
wilcox_test_items <- wilcox.test(merged_data$pre_items, merged_data$post_items, paired = TRUE)
wilcox_test_items
```


## t-tests for individual items:

Here is how you would run t-test for all the likert items, again paired t-tests since the data is pre-post from the same individuals:

```{r t-test for individual items, warning=FALSE}
# t-tests for parametric analysis: Organization, Source, Publish, Write, Research
# organization:
t.test(merged_data$pre_organization, merged_data$post_organization, paired = TRUE)
# Source:
t.test(merged_data$pre_source, merged_data$post_source, paired = TRUE)
# Publish:
t.test(merged_data$pre_publish, merged_data$post_publish, paired = TRUE)
# Write:
t.test(merged_data$pre_write, merged_data$post_write, paired = TRUE)
# Research:
t.test(merged_data$pre_research, merged_data$post_research, paired = TRUE)
```
